# Recycle, Trash, Or Compost user stories

As a user of the app:

- I want to be able to tell the app which junk item I have and have it tell me whether to recycle, compost, or trash it.

- I want the home page to be simple, like Google's

- I also want to be able to research the rules and information of waste management in Seattle.

- I want the information to be displayed not just as a large list of rules.

As a developer:

- handle non-standard
